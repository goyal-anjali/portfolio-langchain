      "Microsoft was rich, powerful and ambitious. It had started to move beyond software. In 1996, it entered the media business in a partnership with NBC, setting up the cable channel, MSNBC, and a website, msnbc.com (Microsoft shed its stakes in both, years later).\n",

      "Today, Google does not loom as large as Microsoft once did. It is one member of the Big Tech club. It is an undisputed giant in search and online advertising, and its software and artificial intelligence prowess can extend to other industries. But its Big Tech peers — Amazon, Apple, Meta (Facebook) and even Microsoft — are all under scrutiny in the United States and abroad.\n",

      "Parts of Microsoft's product portfolio have been in a cyclical decline over the past year, but its diverse business proved that it can take those hits in stride. Revenue last quarter rose 10% year over year after accounting for currency exchange rate shifts, despite slumping demand for PCs and most consumer tech devices. Microsoft offset these challenges with soaring growth in its cloud and enterprise services, anchored by the popular Azure platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "Investors will have trouble finding a more financially impressive business. Microsoft routinely turns more than 40% of its sales into operating profit, for example. That key metric jumped a blazing 21% in the quarter that ended in late June. Microsoft also pays a modest, but quickly growing, dividend.\n",

      "\n",
      "Many days, there were spin sessions on the courthouse steps. Microsoft representatives would say the government had presented isolated snippets of text, taken out of context, certainly not proof of anti-competitive conduct. Lawyers for the Justice Department and states who joined the lawsuit would mostly say the damning testimony spoke for itself.\n",

      "After the George W. Bush administration came to power, the Justice Department and Microsoft reached a settlement. The resulting consent decree prohibited Microsoft from imposing restrictive contracts, freed PC makers to load and feature other companies’ software and forced Microsoft to disclose more technical information.\n",
