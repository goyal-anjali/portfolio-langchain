# Introduction 
This repository intends to be a ground for different PoC(s) that we might be doing
and would love to share them with folks and socialize on it.

# Getting Started
The idea is every PoC could reside in it's own branch with it's own README or any files
which might help people gain some insights on what was going on in that caffiene driven mind when
the code in the branch was cooked up.

This repo has no formal/governed Onebranch build pipeline associated with it, since **at no point
should be using code in this repo as is for any actual tool/service** (though we can definitely seed our actual projects from a snapshot of some code here)

One possible suggestion is that once a PoC is marked complete and we seed a project from that idea, we could bring an entire snapshot of that poc as a folder
on the main branch. We donot still build it and hence don't need to fret over heirarchical builds etc. It just serves as a marker
to show what PoC have turned into actual ideas in some shape or form.

# Build and Test
Each branch could have it's own README describing how to enlist the PoC for some curious sole who might want to play around with
it. 

# Contribute
Feel free to create a branch in this repo and share it's link to folks to socialize. Since at any point
we should not be holding NDA'ed code in here should be safe to share this repo around and extend access(es) as needed.

A general branch naming convention we could use is poc/{author-alias}/{poc-title} or simple poc/{poc-title} since author is implicit from
git history.
